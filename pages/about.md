## **About Me**

<br>Hi there! I am **Vladimir Chistiukhin**,<br> a Software QA Engineer with experience in enhancing quality assurance processes across multiple projects.<br> I like to go through every detail, see the full picture, test the most complicated solutions, and find tricky issues.<br> In the last few years, my primary focus has been on: 
 - creating comprehensive documentation that covers various scenarios.
 - engaging in the entire development process from planning to release.  
 - all-round testing for backend; iOS, android, and web applications.
 - adopting the best practices to improve testing strategies.
