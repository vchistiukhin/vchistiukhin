- title: Joining FreshOffice
  from: Sep 2013
  to: May 2014
  description: My career in IT, I started as a 2nd line support engineer at FreshOffice. This role was my gateway into the tech world, where I learned the nuances of the product and the essentials of software testing. My growing interest and understanding of the product led me to become more involved in the processes of the project. <br><br>
               I wanted to understand everything about our project. How does it work? Why is this issue happening? How can this issue be fixed? Can I somehow help in solving it? It seems my curiosity paid off. I asked so many questions that one day, our CEO mentioned there was an opening for an intern in the QA team, and I could join if I wanted to. To be honest, I didn’t even think of joining the quality assurance team at that time. To me, as a newbie support engineer, our development team seemed like cosmic gods. After short thinking and overcoming my fear, I decided to give it a try.
              
- title: Mastering QA
  from: May 2014
  to: Dec 2014
  description:  In May 2014, I joined FreshOffice QA team as a Junior QA Engineer. This move marked an important milestone in my professional development, shaping my career in tech. As a newcomer, I had a lot to learn about quality assurance, the development process, and IT overall. Luckily, our team of amazing engineers and product managers guided me through this transition period, enabling me to experience my first successes and failures.<br><br>
                At the beginning, I focused on learning the quality assurance practices, processes, and tools. Apart from that, I tried to contribute as much as possible to the project's quality, even as a newcomer. I found myself in a position between the development and support teams, helping both with information exchange, providing guidance to the support team, and learning, learning, and learning.<br><br>

- title: Turning into an Engineer
  from: Jan 2015
  to: Feb 2016
  description: Later in 2014, after mastering the core quality assurance practices, I began working with the testing documentation. Combining my product knowledge and some existing practices, I successfully built test coverage for the most crucial features. At the same time, I delved more deeply into software development as a process, working closely with the dev team. <br><br>
               During 2015, I continued to develop my skill set. I actively engaged in the development process, contributed to feature planning, and began attempting to analyze product specifications. At this point, I was able to cover new functionalities with properly shaped testing documentation, test the new features, and fully participate as a team member.

               At the beginning of 2016, the company faced a financial crisis. As part of the solution, it was decided to focus on supporting existing functionality rather than development. There were massive layoffs in the development and product teams, and although I received an offer to stay on the project, I didn’t see what I could do next given that almost all development was completely frozen. I decided to move on to the next project - <a href="/projects/advisorengine" class="grey-link">AdvisorEngine</a>. <br><br>  
               What I’ve learned at FreshOffice:<br>
               - Mastering the quality assurance processes and tools is a long-term goal.<br>
               - Constant learning helps to overcome the fear of failure.<br>
               - Working with an experienced and kind team is priceless.<br>
               - Even great and successful projects sometimes face a crisis.<br>
