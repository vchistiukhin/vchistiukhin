## My Role
I was involved in the project on part-time basis, controlling the quality of the project and covering it with testing documentation. The entire development and testing processes were quite smooth since the Trivago product team did their job well, and we had all the necessary documentation and design samples. This experience was important for me as I met the greatly structured product documentation and realised the contibution it brings to the project. We managed to fully complete the project before the deadline, satisfying the high standards and expectations of Trivago.
