## My Role
I was involved in the project on a part-time basis, consulting the QA team as I had experience working on a similar product. I helped to design the main testing documentation and set up proper processes for testing. Unfortunately, the project faced a financial crisis soon after the development was launched, and we were unable to complete it at that time.
